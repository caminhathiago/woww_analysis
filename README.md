# Workable Weather Window Analysis

A software for gathering, compiling and performing a weather window analysis with global forecast data from different sources for the purpose of aiding better decision making and operational safety in marine operations. The analysis is based on user-defined operational limits for a desired marine operation.

## To implement
- Plot operation period (operation start + time reference) (Done)
- Select best workable weather window based on statistical comparisons
- Forecast data access via API
  - [WaveWatch III](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/NWW3_Global_Best.html)
